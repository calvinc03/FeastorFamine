# Feast-or-Famine

Feast or Famine is a tower defence game where you place units and destroy incoming enemies. Strategically place units to maximize your food and keep your village safe.
Be careful though, because enemies steal you food upon reaching the village, and running out of food will cause you to lose!

Place units by clicking on the unit button at the bottom of the screen and then clicking on the map. A tower costs 300, a greenhouse costs 500, a hunter is 100, and a wall is 100.
A hunter is a melee attack unit, and a watchtower is a ranged attack unit. A greenhouse will allow you to accumulate food over time.
A wall will block the path of the enemies, making them take longer to reach your village.

Move the camera around by holding spacebar and adjusting the screen. Your remaining food will appear in the top bar of the window.
